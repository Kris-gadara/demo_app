# Task Manager App - Flutter with Firebase

A simple task management application built with Flutter and Firebase. Users can create an account, log in, and manage their tasks using Firestore.

## Project Structure

```
lib/
├── main.dart              # App entry point with Firebase initialization
├── firebase_options.dart  # Firebase configuration (needs to be updated)
├── pages/
│   ├── login_page.dart   # Login/Sign-up page with Firebase Auth
│   └── home_page.dart    # Task management home page with Firestore
```

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login using Firebase Authentication
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- **Firestore Integration**: All tasks are stored in Firestore database
- **User-specific Data**: Each user's tasks are stored in their own Firestore collection
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern Material Design with gradient backgrounds

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable the following services:
   - **Authentication**: Email/Password sign-in method
   - **Firestore Database**: Create a new database in test mode

### Step 2: Configure Firebase for Flutter

Run the FlutterFire CLI setup:

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI if not already installed
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Run the configuration command in the project directory
flutterfire configure
```

This will:
- Automatically detect your Firebase project
- Update `firebase_options.dart` with your credentials
- Configure Firebase for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Firestore Security Rules

In the Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database** > **Rules** and set the following rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      match /tasks/{taskId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Click **Publish** to apply the rules.

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
# For Android
flutter run -d android

# For iOS
flutter run -d ios

# For Web
flutter run -d web

# For Windows
flutter run -d windows
```

## App Usage

1. **Sign Up**: Create a new account with your email and password
2. **Log In**: Use your credentials to log in
3. **Add Tasks**: Enter a task description and click the "+" button
4. **Mark Complete**: Check the checkbox to mark a task as complete
5. **Delete Tasks**: Click the delete icon to remove a task
6. **Log Out**: Click the logout button in the top-right corner

## Database Structure

```
users/
└── {uid}/
    └── tasks/
        └── {taskId}
            ├── title: string
            ├── completed: boolean
            └── createdAt: timestamp
```

## Important Notes

- The `firebase_options.dart` file will be automatically generated by FlutterFire CLI
- Never commit your Firebase credentials to version control
- The app uses test mode for Firestore - remember to switch to production rules before deployment
- Error handling includes user feedback via SnackBars

## Dependencies

- `firebase_core`: ^3.0.0 - Firebase core library
- `firebase_auth`: ^5.0.0 - Authentication service
- `cloud_firestore`: ^5.0.0 - Cloud database
- `flutter`: Latest stable version

## Troubleshooting

### "firebase_options.dart not found"
Run `flutterfire configure` to generate the file.

### Authentication errors
- Ensure Email/Password is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check that your email follows a valid format

### Firestore permission errors
- Verify your Firestore rules allow read/write access
- Ensure you're logged in before accessing tasks

## Next Steps

- Add task categories
- Implement task due dates and notifications
- Add task priority levels
- Implement cloud sync indicators
- Add task search functionality
